# hydra-tutorials
Hydra is a live-coding library created by [Olivia Jack](https://github.com/ojack/hydra#Getting-Started). It is inspired by analog modular synthesizers and is an exploration into using streaming over the web for routing video sources and outputs in realtime. Hydra uses JavaScript and is built in NodeJS. Hydra takes an input → modifies it → and returns an output.

This repository specifcally shows how to work with images and videos in Hydra.
